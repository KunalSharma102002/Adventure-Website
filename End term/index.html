                <h2 class="desc">PARAGLIDING</h2>
                <p class="text">If there is one thing that has been the core of human fancy since ages, it surely is flying. After tasting the heights in the aircraft developed by Wright brothers, many wished to take it to the next level and feel something closer to a bird’s flight! That’s when some crazy dreamer invented paragliding – a thrilling adventure sport that allows you to soar high, with the vast expanse of nature underneath.
                  <br><br>
                  As the sport is relatively new in the country, many of the instructors in these institutes are from countries where it is highly popular. They are trained experts and answer all questions and clarify doubts for the first timers, and even the experienced ones.

                <h2 class="desc">RIVER RAFTING</h2>
                <p class="text">Rafting, the high-adrenaline sport of navigating a river in an inflatable raft. The grades of difficulty are arrived at according to the presence of rapids, which evolve due to sudden plunges in the river’s height, and also because of rocks – small or large – that may be lurking in the waters. 
                    <br><br>
                    Rafting is a challenging but tremendously fun activity – just remember to keep the instructor’s safety tips in mind! White-water (rapids) does invoke fear but river-running done properly – under professional guidance, with the right training, using the appropriate equipment, taking all safety precautions, and by following a set of international safety and ecological norms – can be an extremely safe, enjoyable and exciting soft-adventure sport.
